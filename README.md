# Artificial-Intelligence-Assignments

## About the Project
This repository is to showcase my project of using Python for Artificial Intelligence. It uses Python libraries including **sklearn**, **numpy** and **pandas** for data visualization and pipeline, respectively.

## Getting Started
These are the steps to install and download Python and Visual Studio Code.
  1. Get Python (for free) at https://www.python.org/downloads/
  2. Choose which package to install for your operating device (Mac, Windows, Other Platforms)
  3. (NOTE: you do not need to download Visual Studio Code if you have another preferred IDE. My preference is using Visual Studio Code.) Get Visual Studio Code (for free) at https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  4. Choose which package to install for your operating device (Mac, Windows, Linux).
  5. (Another NOTE: Python already has built-in libraries, including the ones that I have used in this repository).
     
## Usage
In the Python code, it shows Artificial Intelligence's technique such as Hill Climbing. It also shows Naive Bayes Theorem for classification: a Machine Learning algorithmn.
